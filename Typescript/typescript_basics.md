## Typescript Tutorial

## What is Typescript?

Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It is a statically typed language which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. It is compiled to plain Javascript. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft.

## Why Typescript?

- **Type safety**: Typescript provides static typing which helps in catching errors at compile time.
- **Readability**: Typescript code is more readable and understandable.
- **Maintainability**: Typescript code is easier to maintain.
- **Code completion**: Typescript provides code completion which helps in writing code faster.
- **Better tooling**: Typescript provides better tooling support.

## How to install Typescript?

You can install Typescript using npm. Run the following command to install Typescript globally:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

## How to compile Typescript code?

You can compile Typescript code using the `tsc` command. Run the following command to compile a Typescript file:

```
tsc filename.ts
```

This will generate a Javascript file with the same name as the Typescript file.

## Typescript data types

Typescript supports the following data types:

- **Boolean**: Represents a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- **Number**: Represents a number value (integer or floating point).
- **String**: Represents a string value.
- **Array**: Represents an array of values.
- **Tuple**: Represents an array with a fixed number of elements.
- **Enum**: Represents a set of named constants.
- **Any**: Represents any type.
- **Void**: Represents the absence of a type.
- **Null**: Represents a null value.
- **Undefined**: Represents an undefined value.
- **Never**: Represents a value that never occurs.

## Variables

You can declare variables in Typescript using the `let` keyword. For example:

```typescript
let message: string = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message);
```

In the above example, the variable `message` is declared with the type `string` and assigned the value `"Hello, World!"`.

## Functions

You can define functions in Typescript using the `function` keyword. For example:

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(2, 3));
```

In the above example, the function `add` takes two parameters of type `number` and returns a value of type `number`.

## Classes

Classes are a way to define blueprints for objects in Typescript. They provide a template for creating objects with properties and methods.

You can define classes in Typescript using the `class` keyword. For example:

```typescript
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;
  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }
  greet() {
    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the class `Greeter` has a property `greeting` of type `string`, a constructor that initializes the property, and a method `greet` that returns a greeting message.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are a way to define the structure of an object in Typescript. They provide a contract for the shape of an object and can be used to enforce type checking.

You can define interfaces in Typescript using the `interface` keyword. For example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

function greet(person: Person) {
  return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}

let user = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };
console.log(greet(user));
```

In the above example, the interface `Person` defines the structure of a person object with `firstName` and `lastName` properties. The `greet` function takes a `Person` object as a parameter and returns a greeting message.

## Generics

Generics are a way to make components reusable and type-safe. They allow you to write functions, classes, and interfaces that work with any data type.

You can define generics in Typescript using the `<T>` syntax. For example:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let output = identity<string>("Hello, World!");
console.log(output);
```

In the above example, the `identity` function takes a generic type `T` as a parameter and returns a value of the same type. The `output` variable is assigned the result of calling the `identity` function with a `string` argument.

## Modules

Modules are a way to organize code in Typescript. They allow you to split your code into separate files and import/export functionality between them.

You can define modules in Typescript using the `export` and `import` keywords. For example:

```typescript
// greeter.ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

// app.ts
import { greet } from "./greeter";
console.log(greet("World"));
```

In the above example, the `greet` function is defined in the `greeter.ts` module and exported using the `export` keyword. The `app.ts` module imports the `greet` function using the `import` keyword and calls it to print a greeting message.

## Conclusion

This was a brief introduction to Typescript. Typescript is a powerful language that provides type safety, readability, and maintainability to your code. It is widely used in modern web development and has excellent tooling support. I hope this article helped you understand the basics of Typescript. Happy coding!
